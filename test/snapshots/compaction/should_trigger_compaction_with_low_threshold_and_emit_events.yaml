        content: I'm designed to be a concise terminal assistant for software engineering tasks, not a storyteller. I can help
          you with coding, debugging, repository management, running tests, and other development tasks. Would you like
          help with any programming or command-line work instead?
      - role: user

          I didn't tell a dragon story - I'm a coding assistant, not a storyteller. I'm here to help with software
          development tasks like:


          * Writing or debugging code

          * Running tests or builds

          * Managing git repositories

          * Installing dependencies

          * Analyzing codebases


          Is there a programming task I can help you with?
